## Troubleshooting
this requires realm/mongodb/node.js and access to atlas clusters.

## Need to do
I need to put a couple of updates into this application, it works well for tasks but I need to change over the tasks and turn them into games, otherwise everything would be running perfectly. Will be updating within the next week.
